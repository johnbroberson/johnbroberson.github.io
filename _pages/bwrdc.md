*Automated Daily E-mail Service*

This Python script, hosted locally and executed daily, emails a customizable list of recipients daily news clippings about specific political candidates. The service is easily updated, using a structured file of candidates about whom news articles are collected (using <a target="_blank" href="http://newsapi.org/">News API</a>), which are then inserted into a default base HTML email template (provided by <a target="_blank" href="https://htmlemail.io/">HTMLemail</a>). Subscribe and unsubscribe utilities are made available through Google Forms, though currently those forms are not directly linked to the recipients table.
