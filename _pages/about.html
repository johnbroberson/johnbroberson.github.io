  <p>Thanks for stopping by!</p>
    
  <p>I graduated from UNC Chapel Hill in May 2019, where I earned my BA in Public Policy, with Honors and Highest Distinction (UNC doesn't do latin superlatives). I also was <a href="https://uncnews.unc.edu/2019/03/26/205-students-at-unc-chapel-hill-inducted-into-phi-beta-kappa/">inducted into Phi Beta Kappa</a> and graduated as an Honors Laureate, <a href="https://honorscarolina.unc.edu/academics/program-requirements/">a recognition generally based upon difficulty of coursework.</a></p>
   
  <p>While at UNC, my involvement outside of class fell into two primary areas: community service and progressive politics. I graduated as a member of the <a href="https://ccps.unc.edu/inaugural-macdonald-community-service-scholars-begin-their-work/">inaugural class</a> of UNC <a href="https://ccps.unc.edu/awards-fellowships/macdonald-community-fellowships/">MacDonald Community Serivce Scholars</a> and as a <a href="https://ccps.unc.edu/bpss/">Buckley Public Service Scholar</a>. The MacDonald scholarship is granted to (roughly) four students per year and includes partial tuition funding, mentorship, and funding for a one- to two-year independent fellowship project. Through the MacDonald scholarship and the Buckley program, I completed over 1,000 hours of service in my time at UNC.</p>
    
  <p>Several hundred of those hours were made up of progressive political involvement. As early as my first semester at UNC, I became deeply involved with campus activism, quickly becoming a leading organizer of "Carolina Students for Bernie" by the winter of 2015. I continued volunteering for Democrats throughout the remainder of the 2016 election, and worked for a public interest lobby that summer as well. After the 2016 election, I started interning at the NC Democratic Senate Caucus in Raleigh, and was then invited to take up a paid position at the overall state party starting in the summer of 2017. I stayed in that position - commuting roughly an hour each way, three days a week - through the end of the 2018 cycle, including a stint working full-time (and salaried!) for the summer of 2018.</p> 
    
  <p>Now, post-graduation, I am working for a Democratic consulting firm in Raleigh, NC, helping campaigns with their finance and compliance needs. I plan to return to school after the 2020 cycle, which brings me to the multiple purposes of this website. First, and naturally, it serves the primary purpose of any personal website - to collect and store important information for future school or job applications, and just general reminisching. Secondly, because I'm going to be out of academia for several years, it will serve as a place where I can document my ongoing (informal) research (read: fiddling, tinkering), to prove I haven't been sitting on my butt the whole time. Finally, I hope the fact I've built this site on GitHub (on the shoulders of <a href="https://academicpages.github.io">an awesome template</a>), using a combination of Markdown, HTML, CSS, Python, R, and RMarkdown gives a small boost to my data science and digital design bona fides.</p>

  <p>To all of those ends, below is a list of the pages available on this site. Thanks again for visiting!</p>
