  <p>I work full-time in political compliance and am a self-taught developer on the side. On this site, you can find my resume, coding projects, academic research, and graphic design portfolio. The <a href="/about/"><b>About</b></a> page is a good place to start, and descriptions of the remaining pages can be found below.</p>
  
  <p>My current focus is developing the second (this time web-based) generation of <a href="https://www.scrubapp.org" target="_blank"><b>Scrub</b></a>, an application I built to automate various campaign finance workflows. You can read more about it on its site as well as on my <a href="http://dev.scrubapp.org/blog" target="_blank"><b>development blog</b></a>.</p>

  <p>In addition to what's hosted here on this site, you can also find some of my social media and contact information in the sidebar to the left. Thanks for visiting!</p>
