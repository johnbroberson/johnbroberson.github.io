*Desktop Application*

This program's primary function is to perform basic 'scrubbing' of contribution data, a routine yet time-consuming process in campaign finance and compliance workflows. I created **Scrub** using Python on Windows. Its components are as follows:

+ Graphic interface through tkinter
+ Data processing through pandas and re
+ Packaging through pyinstaller

Users can set and save default preferences across sessions, as well as create and edit a table of loadable values to write to the final, scrubbed datafile.
